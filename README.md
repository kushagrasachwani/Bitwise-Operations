# Bitwise-Operations
The bitwise operators are the operators used to perform the operations on the data at the bit-level.
In C programming language, there are six bitwise operators that allow you to manipulate the bits of a variable. These operators are:

1. Bitwise AND (&): performs the AND operation on each corresponding bit of two operands. The result is 1 if both bits are 1, otherwise, it is 0.

2. Bitwise OR (|): performs the OR operation on each corresponding bit of two operands. The result is 1 if either bit is 1, otherwise, it is 0.

3. Bitwise XOR (^): performs the XOR operation on each corresponding bit of two operands. The result is 1 if the bits are different, otherwise, it is 0.

4. Bitwise NOT (~): performs the NOT operation on each bit of the operand. It changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.

5. Left shift (<<): shifts the bits of the first operand to the left by the number of positions specified in the second operand. The leftmost bits are filled with 0.

6. Right shift (>>): shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified in the second operand. The rightmost bits are filled with 0 for unsigned operands and with the sign bit for signed operands.
